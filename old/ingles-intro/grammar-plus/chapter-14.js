Hi!
I didn't do anything special this weekend, but I had a lot of fun.
I didn't go out on Friday night. I stayed home.
I cleaned my room and did the laundry.
I helped my sister with her homework, and then we watched our favorite series.
On Saturday, my friend Lori come over. 
She needded some new shoes, so we took the bus downtowen to Todd's Shoes Store.
We shopped at the and exercised. 
We didn't ecercise very hard.
I invited Lori for dinner, and my dad cooked hamburgers in the yard.
After dinner, Lori and I talked and played video games.
She didn't stay very late - my mother drove her home at around ten.
On Sunday, my shole family visited my mother's best friend and her family.
They have a swimming pool, so my sister and I went swimming all afternoon.
Tell me about your wekkend !
Maya.
