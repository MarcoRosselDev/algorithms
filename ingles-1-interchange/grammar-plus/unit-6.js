1.  Adverbs of frequency

Adverbs of frequency (always, almost always, usually, often, 
sometimes, hardly ever, almost never, never) usually come before
the main verb:

    I almost always eat breakfast.

    BUT. Adverbs of frequency usually come after the verb be:
    I'm always late.

Usually and sometimes can begin a sentence:
    Usually I walk to work.
    Sometimes I exercise in the morning.

Some frequency expressions usually come at the end of a sentence:

        Do you exercise every day?
        I exercise three times a week.
