sometimes, hardly ever, almost never, never) usually come before
the main verb:

/* 2    Questions with how: short answers


Don't confuse good and well. Use the adjective good with be and the adverb well
with other verbs:
    How good are you at soccer?
    How weel do you play soccer?

    Es importante recordar que "good" describe tanto una persona como una cosa,
    pero well solo se utiliza cuando describe una cosa (no una persona).
    Por ejemplo:
        He's a good cook.   (es un buen cocinero)
        He cooks well.      (concina bien)
        I'm good. vs I'm well.
