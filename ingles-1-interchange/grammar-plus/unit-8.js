/* UNIT 8

1.  There is, there are: one, any, some

Don't use a contraction in a short answer with Yes:
    Is there a hotel near here?
        Yes, there is
            NOT:-----> Yes, there's.

Use some in affirmative statements and any in negative statements:
    There are some grocery stores in my neighborhood, 
    but there aren't any restaurans.
    
Use any in most questions:
    Are there any nice stores around here?
