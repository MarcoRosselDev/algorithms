/* UNIT 2

1.  Simple present Wh-questions and statements

Statements-----------------------------------------------------
Verbs with he/she/it end in -s: He/She walks to school, BUT I/You/We/They walk 
to school.

Have, go, and do are irregular with he/she/it: She has a class at 1:00.
He goes to school at night. She does her homework before school.

Wh-questions---------------------------------------------------
Use does in questions with he/she/it and do with all the others: Where does
he/she/it live? Where do I/you/we/they live?

Don't add -s to the verb: Where does she live? (NOT: Where does she lives?)
