Ashley      Oh, no!
Jessica     What's the matter?
Ashley      It's snowing! Wow, it's so cold and windy!
Jessica     Are you wearing your gloves?
Ashley      No, I'm not. They're at home.
Jessica     What about your scarf?
Ashley      It's at home, too.
Jessica     Well, you're wearing your coat.
Ashley      But my coat isn't very warm.
            And I'm not wearing boots!
Jessica     OK. Let's take a taxi.
Ashley      Good idea!
