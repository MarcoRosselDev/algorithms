/* 14   Simple past statements: regular verbs and irregular verbs

Use simple past verbs to talk about the past.
Regular verbs end in -ed:
    I watched TV last night.

For verbs end in -e, add -d:

Hi!
I didn't do anything special this weekend, but I
had a lot of fun. I didn't go out on Friday night.
I stayed home. I cleaned my room and I did the laundry. 
I helpped my sister with her homework,
and then we wathed our favorite series.
On Saturday, my freind Lori come over. She needed some new shoes,
so we taked the bus downtown to Todd's Shoes Store.
We shopped for a long time, but Lori didn't like any of the shoes at Todd's.
She buyed some puple socks, but she didn't buy any shoes.
On our way back to my house, we stoped at the gym and exerciseed.
We didn't exercise very hard. I invited Lori for dinner and my dad cooked hamburgers in the yard.
After dinner, Lori and I talked and played video games.
She didn't stay vary late -  my mother drived her home at around ten.
On Sunday, my whole family visited my mother's best friend and her family.
They have a swimming pool, so my sister and I went swimming all afternoon.
Tell me about your weekend!
Maya.
