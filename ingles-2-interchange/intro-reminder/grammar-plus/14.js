Complete the sentences with the simple past form of the verbs in parentheses.

Hi!
I didn't do anything special this weekend, but I
had a lot of fun. I didn't go out on Friday night.
I stayed home. I cleaned my room and I did the laundry. 
I helped my sister with her homework,
and then we watched our favorite series.
On Saturday, my freind Lori come over. She needed some new shoes,
so we took the bus downtown to Todd's Shoes Store.
We shopped for a long time, but Lori didn't like any of the shoes at Todd's.
She bought some puple socks, but she didn't buy any shoes.
On our way back to my house, we stopped at the gym and exercised.
We didn't exercise very hard. I invited Lori for dinner and my dad cooked hamburgers in the yard.
After dinner, Lori and I talked and played video games.
She didn't stay too late -  my mother drove her home at around ten.
On Sunday, my whole family visited my mother's best friend and her family.
They have a swimming pool, so my sister and I went swimming all afternoon.
Tell me about your weekend!
Maya.
